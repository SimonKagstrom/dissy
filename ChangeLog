	* Register value analysis added for Arm. This is still inactive
	though (Mads Chr. Olesen)

	* Make toggling options persistent (save options so that they are
	remembered on next start)

	* Refactor highlighting in the Instruction model class to allow it to
	be more easily extendible (Mads Chr. Olesen)

	* Add an information box right of the instruction view that describes
	what the current instruction does (Mads Chr. Olesen)

	* Highlight the instruction that (most likely) set the condition flags
	if the current instruction is conditional (Mads Chr. Olesen)

	* Added an icon (icon.svg). Please make a nicer version!

	* Add licensing info to file headers and fix email address

	* Convert tabs to spaces (fix from Mads Chr. Olesen)

	* Fix close of about dialogue (patch from Lubomir Rintel)

	* Fix deprecated file dialogue (patch from Mads Chr. Olesen, thanks)

	* Special-case Linux crashes. This allows you to paste things like

	    [ 3796.619417]  [<c031f2ef>] ? ext2_free_blocks+0xfa/0x2b7
	    [ 3796.619417]  [<c024982b>] ? activate_page+0x9a/0xa2
	    [ 3796.619417]  [<c0322c5f>] ? ext2_free_branches+0x12d/0x190
	    [ 3796.619417]  [<c02820ef>] ? __getblk+0x27/0x294

	into the dissy "address bar" and get a nice callback

	* bdnz+/- for PowerPC

	* Workaround for a objdump bug on (at least) some MIPS binaries,
	where addresses are internally 64 bits. If dissy finds no
	instructions in a function, it will therefore try to sign-extend
	the value and use that

	* Support for setting the OBJDUMP environment variable to set the
	objdump to use (idea from Joseph E. Garvey)

	* Initial ARM support (i.e., support for visualizing jumps -
	disassembly has always worked)

	* Better support for PowerPC (instruction regexp + handling of
	more branch instructions)

	* History handling has changed to more match that of a
	web-browser, overwriting the "current" entry instead of appending
	after it

Dissy (6)
	* New ChangeLog format

	* Better "location bar" behavior: Allow multiple words to be
	pasted and do more intelligent handling of numbers

	* Added navigation history with back/forward (like in web
	browsers)

	* Fixed MIPS register regexp to handle k registers

	* Added manpage written by the Varun Hiremath of the Debian
	project, and documented the new features

	* Fixed bug where the -t option made it impossible to search
	  for addresses

2007-03-11 Simon Kågström <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com> (5)
	* Don't parse symbols eagerly (this improves performance a lot)

	* Added some missing jump instructions on IA-32

2006-11-25 Simon Kågström <ska@bth.se> (4)
	* Added PPC support (Andrew May)

	* Added a text entry for marking certain patterns, e.g., to
	highlight certain registers and so in the text. The pattern is a
	regular expression

	* Fixed checks to avoid a few non-fatal exceptions

	* Added tooltips

	* Setting of colors is now possible in the preferences dialogue

2006-10-14 Simon Kågström <ska@bth.se> (3)
	* Added ability to search for instructions and registers

	* Fixed bug in label lookup

2006-09-03 Simon Kågström <ska@bth.se> (2)
	* Much faster loading of files. Only load a list of symbols and
	then load and links each function on demand.

	* More clever use of objdump, nm and readelf

	* Added reload menu option

	* Better IA-32 architecture support
